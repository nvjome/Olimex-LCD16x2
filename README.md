# OLIMEX_LCD16x2

Arduino library for the [OLIMEX 16x2 LCD shield](https://www.olimex.com/Products/Duino/Shields/SHIELD-LCD16x2/), which includes an LCD, buttons, and additional GPIO pins.

Bassed off of the original library developed by OLIMEX LTD with the followign improvements:

- Conforms to Arduino library specifications.
- Improves function naming, now similar to the official [LiquidCrystal](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/LiquidCrystal) library.
- Adds usage of `print` and `println` to match Arduino convention.

## ToDo

- Add buttons to `digitalRead` and `digitalWrite` functions.
